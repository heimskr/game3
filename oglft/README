OGLFT Version 0.8

OGLFT is a library for drawing text in OpenGL. It usees the FreeType 2
library to extract information from font files on your system. OGLFT
can handle any of the files which FreeType can read, both vector and
bitmapped (although currently the bitmap routines are not implemented).

The software is available from www.sf.net/project/oglft.

The documentation is in ./doc/html/index.html.

The mailing list is oglft-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.

A couple of installation notes:

OGLFT depends on the GLE Tubing and Extrusion library to create solid
characters. If you don't have this library (or don't want solid
glyphs), you can disable this feature with:

./configure --disable-solid

If the configure script can't find the GLE library and header files,
it is disabled automatically.

UNICODE character rendering, Demo3 and the performance test code
depend on the Qt library. You can disable them with:

./configure --disable-qt

Note that the configure script depends on finding the environment
variable QTDIR in order to locate the headers and library for Qt (if
not disabled). If the configure script can't successfully build a
simple Qt app, Qt is disabled automatically.

'make check' builds the test programs in the tests/ directory.

There is also a (mostly untested) Qt project file from which it may be
possible to generate a Makefile for operating systems for which
autoconf is not supported. Edit the files ./OGLFT/OGLFT.pro and
./tests/tests.pro to change the values to those appropriate for your
operating system. Generate the library and the test program by doing a
"make install" (this will actually only copy the library to the ./lib
directory).
