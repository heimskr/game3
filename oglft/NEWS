New in OGLFT version 0.9

  * Moved my CVS repository so this is mostly a resync.

  * A couple of minor changes to configure.ac for RH Linux 9, too.

New in OGLFT version 0.8

  * Added the ability to draw numbers with a format à la printf.
    There is also a format, %p, which will draw the number as
    a fraction.

  * Updated the source to be compilable with G++ 3.

  * Added an (untested) Qt project for OSs which don't support
    autoconf.

  * Note: FreeType versions 2.0.9 through 2.1.2 contain a bug which
    prevents rotated text from being rendered correctly.

New in OGLFT version 0.7

  * Fixed another memory leak when deleting a Face which had compiled
    its glyphs into display lists (the default behavior).

  * Added the ability to render UNICODE glyphs using Qt QStrings.

  * Added the ability to use mulitple FT_Faces in a single OGLFT::Face
    so that you can cover more UNICODE points by combining fonts.

New in OGLFT version 0.6

  Updates include:

  * Fixed a pervasive memory leak (must call FT_Done_Glyph after each
    call to FT_Get_Glyph).

  * measure() now queries the OpenGL view and calls gluUnProject to
    compute accurate glyph sizes.

  * Autoconf-enabled.

  * There is a user color callback for drawing the Outline face and
    color and texture coordinate callbacks for the Filled face.

  * Can pass an already open FreeType FT_Face to a rendering style.

  * Changes to improve compilation on the SGI.
